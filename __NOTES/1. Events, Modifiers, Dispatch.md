# EVENTS, MODIFIERS AND OTHER THINGS

`on:` SYNTAX IS JUST A SHORTHAND FOR `addEventListener` USAGE; SINCE YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT SVELTE DOESN'T USE VIRTUAL DOM AND SYTETIC EVENTS

# PLAYING AROUND WITH `on:mousemove`

```svelte
<script lang="ts">

  let X: number = 0;
  let Y: number = 0;


  const handleMousemove = (event: MouseEvent) => {

    const x = event.clientX;
    const y = event.clientY;

    X = x;
    Y = y;
  }
</script>


<!-- I ADDED HANDLER ON THIS ELEMENT -->
<div
  on:mousemove={handleMousemove}
  class="card w-96 bg-base-100 shadow-xl"
>
  <div
     
    class="card-body"
  >
    <h2 class="card-title">{X} {Y}</h2>
    <p>If a dog chews shoes whose shoes does he choose?</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="https://placeimg.com/400/225/arch" alt="Shoes" /></figure>
</div>
```

# MODIFIERS

THEY USE "PIPE SYNTAX" (`|`)

# `|once` MODIFIER

HIS NAME IS PRETTY SUGESTIVE OF THE THING IT ACOMPLISHES

```svelte
<button
  on:click|once={() => {alert("Hello World!")}}
  class="btn btn-primary"
>
  Press
</button>
```

# THE REST OF THE MODIFIERS

`|preventDefault`

`|stopPropagation` (PREVEENTS EVENT TO REACH NEXT ELEMNT)

`|passive` (IMPROVES SCROLLING PERFORMANCE)

`|capture`

`|self` (TRIGGERS EVENT ONLY IF event.target IS ELEMENT ITSELF (RATHER THAN A CHILD ELEMENT))

# COMPONENT EVENTS (DISPATCHING)

A WAY TO DISPATCH EVENT FROM INNER COMPONENT

<https://svelte.dev/tutorial/component-events>

**FOR EXAMPLE IF CLICK HAPPENS IN CHILD COMPONENT, YOU WANT THAT PARENT COMPONENT CAN "CATCH THAT EVENT" (WE CAN ACOMPLISH THAT BY DISPATCHING EVENT FROM CHILD COMPONENT)**

THIS IS CHILD COMPONENT

```
touch src/components/Inner.svelte
```

```svelte
<script lang="ts">

  import {createEventDispatcher} from 'svelte'

  const dispatch = createEventDispatcher()


  const handleClick = () => {
    // WE DEFINE LABLE WHEN DISPATCHING
    dispatch("shiba", {
      // THIS IS TEXT WE ARE SENDING
      data: "Hello World"
    })
  }


</script>

<button on:click={handleClick}>
  Click To Send Event
</button>
```

THIS IS PARENT COMPONENT

```
touch src/components/Parent.svelte
```

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  // THIS IS OUR CHILD COMPONENT
  import Inner from '$components/Inner.svelte'

  function handlePayload(ev: any){

    // WE SETTED UP THAT WE ARE SENDING OUR DATA
    // INSIDE data PROPERTY
    alert(ev.detail.data)

  }

</script>

<div>
  <h1>Parent component</h1>
  <div>
    
    <!-- IN INNER COMPONENT WE NAMED EVENT AS "shiba"
    SO WE ANTICIPATE "shiba" EVENT -->
    <Inner on:shiba={handlePayload} />
  </div>
</div>
```

I THINK IT IS PRETTY CLEAR WHAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS

## COMPONENT EVENT FORWARDING

**IMAGINE EXAMPLE ABOVE, BUT LETS SAY THAT IS `Inner.svelte` IS NESTED FEW LEVELS DOWN (IMAGINE ONE EXTRA LEVEL FOR SAKE THAT WE DO THIS EXAMPLE QUICKER) IN ITS PARRENT**

WE HAVE A "GRAND PARENT" THAT IS "SUBSCRIBED" TO COMPONENT EVENT (A COMPONENT EVENT THAT COMES FROM HIS MNTIONED DESCENDANT)

```
cat src/components/GrandParent.svelte
```

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  
  // this Daughter doesn't handle event (not anticipating  it)
  import Daughter from '$components/Daughter.svelte'

  function handlePayload(ev: any){
    alert(ev.detail.data)
  }

</script>

<div>
  <h1>Parent component</h1>
  <div>
    <!-- THIS IS Daughter THAT STANDS "IN BETWEEN GRANDFATER" ("SUBSCRIBER")
    AND HIS GRAND-DAUGHTER (WHO IS TRIGGERING THE COMPONENT EVENT)
      -->
      <!-- WE ARE PASSING THE FUNCTION LIKE THIS, EVEN
      THIS COMPONENT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH AN EVENT
      MEANING IT IS NOT DISPATCHING IT -->
    <Daughter on:shiba={handlePayload} />
  </div>
</div>
```

**THIS IS A COMPONENT THAT TRIGGERS EVENT (A COMPONENT THAT IS GRAND DAUGHTER OF COMPONENT ABOVE)**

```
cat src/components/GrandChild.svelte
```

```svelte
<script lang="ts">

  import {createEventDispatcher} from 'svelte'

  const dispatch = createEventDispatcher()


  const handleClick = () => {
    // WE DEFINE LABLE WHEN DISPATCHING
    dispatch("shiba", {
      // THIS IS TEXT WE ARE SENDING
      data: "Hello World"
    })
  }

</script>

<button on:click={handleClick}>
  Click To Send Event
</button>
```

**A Daughter COMPONENT; WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WILL SECURE "A EVENT FLOW FROM GRAND DAUGHTER TO THEIR GRAND PARENT"**

A DAUGHTER COMPONENT IS LIKE MEDIATOR BETWEEN GRANDPARENT AND GRAND CHILD

SEE WHAT WE DID TO SECURE "EVEN FLOW" FROM GRAND CHILD TO GRAND PARENT 

```
code
```

```svelte
<script>
  import GrandChild from '$components/GrandChild.svelte'
</script>


<!-- WE JUST DID THIS -->
<!-- NO PASSING OF NYTHING ELSE -->
<GrandChild on:shiba />
```

NOW YOU SECURE THAT GRANDPARENT WILL GET THE EVENT DISPATCHED BY GRAND CHILD

# YOU CAN ALSO FORWARD A DOM EVENT, LIKE "click" OR SOME OTHER EVENT

GOOD EXAMPLE (GOOD USE CASE) OF THIS WOULD BE: **PUTING AN `on:click` EVENT HANLER ON SVELTE COMPONENT WHICH IS RENDERING SOME CUSTOM BUTTON*

THIS IS YOUR CUSTOM BUTTON

```
touch src/components/AccentButton.svelte
```

```svelte
<button class="btn btn-active btn-accent">
  <slot />
</button>
```
