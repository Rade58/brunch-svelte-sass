# Bindings

**THIS IS A "THING OF THE FORM ELEMENTS"**

## For text inputs

THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DOING WHEN WE DON'T USE BINDINGS; WE USE `on:input` EVENT HANDLER IKE THIS

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  let inputData = ""
  $: console.log({inputData})
</script>

<input 
  type="text"
  on:input={(e) => {inputData = e.currentTarget.value}}
  value={inputData}
/>
```

**BUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WHEN WE NEED TO USE A CONTROLLED INPUT** (YOU REMEMBER THIS FROM REACT)

**THE THING WE NEED TO CHANGE IS DIRECTION OF DATA FLOW, THAT IS NORMALLY GOING FROM A PARENT TO CHILD COMPONENT**

**WE ARE DOING THIS WITH `bind:`**

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  let inputData = ""
  $: console.log({inputData})

</script>

<input 
  bind:value={inputData}
/>
```
