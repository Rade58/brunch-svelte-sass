# Bindings

**THIS IS A "THING OF THE FORM ELEMENTS"**

## For text inputs

THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DOING WHEN WE DON'T USE BINDINGS; WE USE `on:input` EVENT HANDLER IKE THIS

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  let inputData = ""
</script>

<input type="text" on:input={(e) => {inputData = e.currentTarget.value}}  />
<div>{inputData}</div>
```

**BUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WHEN E NEED TO USE A CONTROLLED INPUT**

THIS IS WHAT WE DIDI IN REACT WHEN WE ARE CHANGING STATE BUT WE ATRE PIPING THAT STATE BACK IN TH INPUT AS A VALUE
