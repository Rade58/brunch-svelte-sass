# EVENTS, MODIFIERS AND OTHER THINGS

`on:` SYNTAX IS JUST A SHORTHAND FOR `addEventListener` USAGE; SINCE YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT SVELTE DOESN'T USE VIRTUAL DOM AND SYTETIC EVENTS

# PLAYING AROUND WITH `on:mousemove`

```svelte
<script lang="ts">

  let X: number = 0;
  let Y: number = 0;


  const handleMousemove = (event: MouseEvent) => {

    const x = event.clientX;
    const y = event.clientY;

    X = x;
    Y = y;
  }
</script>


<!-- I ADDED HANDLER ON THIS ELEMENT -->
<div
  on:mousemove={handleMousemove}
  class="card w-96 bg-base-100 shadow-xl"
>
  <div
     
    class="card-body"
  >
    <h2 class="card-title">{X} {Y}</h2>
    <p>If a dog chews shoes whose shoes does he choose?</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="https://placeimg.com/400/225/arch" alt="Shoes" /></figure>
</div>
```

# MODIFIERS

THEY USE "PIPE SYNTAX" (`|`)

# `|once` MODIFIER

HIS NAME IS PRETTY SUGESTIVE OF THE THING IT ACOMPLISHES

```svelte
<button
  on:click|once={() => {alert("Hello World!")}}
  class="btn btn-primary"
>
  Press
</button>
```

# THE REST OF THE MODIFIERS

`|preventDefault`

`|stopPropagation` (PREVEENTS EVENT TO REACH NEXT ELEMNT)

`|passive` (IMPROVES SCROLLING PERFORMANCE)

`|self` (TRIGGERS EVENT ONLY IF event.target IS ELEMENT ITSELF)
