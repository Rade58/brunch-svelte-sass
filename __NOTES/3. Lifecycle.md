# LIFECYCLE

YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT

# onMount

<https://svelte.dev/tutorial/onmount>

```svelte
<script lang="ts">

  import {onMount} from 'svelte'

  let data: any;

  onMount(async () => {


    await new Promise((res) => {
      setTimeout(res, 2000)
    })

    const res = await fetch("https://random-data-api.com/api/cannabis/random_cannabis?size=30")
  
    data = await res.json()
  
  })

</script>


{#if data}
 <pre>
  {JSON.stringify({data}, null, 2)}
 </pre>
 {:else}
 <div>loading...</div>   
{/if}
```

# onDestroy

A GOOD PLACE TO CLEAR TIMER TIMERS AND SIMILAR THINGS; TO STOP MEMORY LEAK

IT WILL ALSO RUN INSIDE SERVER SIDE RENDERING 

IT WILL EXECUTE WHEN YOU NAVIGATE OF THE PAGE

# LIFECYCLE METHODS CAN BE ABSTRACTED OUT IN SOME OTHER FUNCTION

YOU CAN DEFINE ALL KINDS OF HELPERS WITH LIFECYCLE METHODS AN IMPORT THAT METHOD IN YOUR COMPONENT

SO YOU DON'T NEED TO DUPLICATE LOGIC THAT DOES THE SAME THING

# beforeUpdate AND afterUpdate

YOU DON'T NEED TO USE THEM OFFTEN, BUT THEY ARE USEFULL WHEN YOU NEED TO DO SOME PROBABLY DIFFICULT THING

UPDATING OF SCROLL POSITION WOULD BE ONE OF USE CASES

<https://svelte.dev/tutorial/update>

ON ABOVES LINK IS A GOOD EXAMPLE WHERE YOU NEED TO ACOMPLISH SCROLLING TO THE BOTTOM WHEN UI UPDATES
